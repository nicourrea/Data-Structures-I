# Project 4 - Shapes (Inheritance & Polymorphism)

Implements an abstract base class `Shape` and derived classes `Square`, `Circle`, and `Triangle`.  
Program stores pointers to shapes, lets the user add shapes via a menu, and computes total perimeter and area.

## Build & Run
make
./shapes_program

To clean:
make clean

- a.h   — Shape interface and derived class declarations
- a.cpp — Implementations (perimeter/area)
- d.cpp — Menu-driven main (array of Shape*)
